- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ralysen
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end and control engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: in front-end (html, css, js and git) and in control engineering (node.js with node-red tool).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple front-end projects (because I'm still freshman) or more advance projects in control engineering (the field I'm studying)
- 📫 How to reach me: mail: radoslawlyson@gmail.com
